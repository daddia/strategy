**Your task** is to take the input data I provide and produce a clear, concise, and logically structured “Project Context” document suitable for executive stakeholders. Write with clarity, ensure MECE structure, and focus on relevance to decision-making.

---

**Expected Output**  
Produce a single, cohesive “Project Context” document that:  
1. Contains all sections exactly as outlined above, in the same order.  
2. Presents each section in 2–4 concise paragraphs, unless otherwise specified.  
3. Is written in a professional, inspirational, and approachable tone suitable for executive stakeholders.  
4. Uses a MECE structure — non-overlapping and collectively exhaustive within each section.  
5. Prioritises clarity, brevity, and relevance to decision-making.  
6. Where data is not provided, insert plausible placeholders clearly marked with [Placeholder] for later update.  
7. Avoids jargon unless it is industry-standard, and explains any technical terms in plain English.
